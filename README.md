# CISC3140_Lab5
## Description 
The report show aggregate values that are computed from the CSV file provided by
```sh
git submodule add -f https://gist.github.com/d66a59b6db4e59c16efd4c42ad411f8e.git data
```
Use the backend API created in [CISC3140_Lab4](https://github.com/jiaojiaon/CISC3140_Lab4.git) to view data that is stored in a database as well as update data.

## Objective

The objective of this lab is to build a front-end that complements the back-end that you created in Lab 4. The lab will use a combination of HTML/CSS/JS users to view data that is stored in a database as well as update data.

## Requirements:

My web application support the following features:

a. Viewing data that is in the database (use tables)

- Display results of select all - i.e., all cars present in the database, winning cars, car ownersâ€™ contact information, showing results per class

- Display data that comes as a collection (i.e. requires iterating through multiple records) and also as a single record

b. Inserting new data record(s)

-  Support creating new record in database table(s). Aim for adding record to at least two different existing tables for more practice.

c. Updating data records

- Support updating records in database table(s). Aim for at least two different use cases (i.e. updating email address, etc ).

## Bug
As you open the web and click on the Cars or Owners tab, you may see blank rows inside the table. That's because when I used postman to test my API, there are some mistakes happen so it added blank to the table.

Since I don't have time to work on the delete part, I can't delete the blank rows.
